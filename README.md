This go-app component library creates a development environment that rivals the best JavaScript tooling, with instant visual feedback and minimal context switching.

The time between writing code and seeing its visual impact directly correlates with developer productivity and creative flow. Traditional Go development workflows, optimized for server applications, fall short for UI development where visual feedback is paramount.
